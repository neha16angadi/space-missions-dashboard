Reasons I chose the 3 visualizations:

Missions by company
I chose a bar chart because it clearly shows the number of missions each company has launched. This makes it easy for users to compare companies and quickly see which ones have the most activity.

missions over time
I chose a line chart to visualize missions over time because it shows trends in space launches year by year. It helps users understand growth patterns and historical peaks in mission activity.

missions by location
I chose a bar chart for missions by location because it is easy to see which launch sites are most active. This visualization helps users quickly compare locations and identify key areas for space missions.
